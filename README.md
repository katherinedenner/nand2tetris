This repository tracks my progress through the projects in "Elements of Computing Systems", a book that takes the reader through the various levels of abstraction needed to run a Tetris game. Includes the rudiments of digital logic and hardware description languages (01, 02, 03, 05), assembly language programming (04), assemblers (06), virtual machines (07, 08), high-level programming (09), compilers (10, 11), and operating systems (12).

Stack includes Python and three simple languages created for the text: HDL (a hardware description language), Jack (an assembly language), and Hack (a machine language).
